                        “Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they’ll get sent back. More
                        importantly, they may not make it.” - President Barack Obama
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Obama’s warning, delivered at the height of what his administration described as a humanitarian
                        crisis at the southern border, was part of the escalation in anti-immigrant rhetoric that
                        emerged in 2014. The 2014 Border Crisis, as it is commonly described, gestures to the
                        significant uptick in Central American unaccompanied children and families with young children
                        migrating to the United States along the Southwestern border, and particularly at one sector of
                        the Customs and Border Patrol — the Rio Grande Valley. In the public discourse, the crisis was
                        framed alongside calls for “common sense immigration reform” that would keep the border secure
                        by “protecting public safety and deporting dangerous criminals” while articulating the economic
                        and social benefits of immigrants already in the United States and who “play by the rules”. These
                        statements were accompanied by a slate of executive actions that expanded
                        migrant detention (particularly for families and children), outsourced certain border patrol
                        operations to Central American countries, and invested in technology, infrastructure, and
                        resources along the southwestern border.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These unprecedented interventions set the scene for the future of border security for the
                        remainder of the Obama administration and the soon-to-come Trump administration.

                    <h3>
                        “At this very moment, large, well-organized caravans of migrants are marching towards our
                        southern border. Some people call it an ‘invasion.’ It’s like an invasion. They have violently
                        overrun the Mexican border.” - President Donald Trump
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        The Obama era calls for “commonsense immigration reform” were replaced in 2016 by President
                        Trump’s increasingly violent and public calls to secure the border from “dangerous influxes” of
                        immigrants at the southwestern border. This rhetoric reached a peak during in 2018, when a
                        “caravan” of migrants from Central America approached the border. This resulted in executive
                        orders to construct a physical border wall, as well as efforts to expand immigrant detention and
                        border patrol forces, while limiting asylum protections.
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        These policy changes were mirrored by an increasing militarization of the border region that
                        eroded constitutional protections and human rights along the southwestern border. The
                        militarization of the border has meant an increase in the U.S. Border Patrol access to resources
                        and authority, hiring of military veterans and use of military surplus in the border region, and
                        a culture of violence and abuse that curtails human rights at the border. In other
                        words, border militarization has increased the risks to the safety of migrants by expanded
                        violent systems that treat migrants like enemy combatants, to be deported and detained.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Trump administration rhetoric on border security has also inspired an uptick in far-right
                        border vigilantes that have mobilized at the southern border to defend against this “invasion,”
                        sometimes even collaborating with the U.S. Border Patrol to apprehend migrants. While
                        Trump had called for National Guard troops to mobilize at the border, these far right militias
                        organized to patrol the border as well. Particularly well publicized was a viral incident from
                        New Mexico in April 2019, when Larry Hopkins and his United Constitutional Patriots armed
                        militia group kidnapped and detained a large group of migrants at the border. While the Border
                        Patrol claims not endorse the activities of these border militias, there’s a long history of
                        collaboration between white supremacist militia groups and the Border Patrol, that is grounded
                        in violent histories of American border.

                    <p>
                        These border vigilantes are situated in a much longer history of white supremacy, violence, and
                        the U.S. Border. In 1977, the Ku Klux Klan, led by David Duke announced plans to patrol the
                        U.S.-Mexico border to hunt and detain undocumented immigrants. While it caused an uproar, their
                        plan of action was to move up and down the border and report any immigrants that they found to
                        the closest Border Patrol station. Their actions mirrored a previous steps taken by armed
                        anti-immigrant groups and nativists to keep out immigrants: the Know Nothings that attacked
                        Irish and German neighborhoods across the East Coast in the 1800s, the Know Nothing affiliate
                        groups that lynched Chinese immigrants in California in the 1850s, the Texas Rangers that
                        prevented Mexicans from crossing the border after the Mexican Revolution in 1910, and the
                        Knights of the KKK attacks on Vietnamese fisherman in the 1980s, among countless others
                        . The Border Patrol itself was authorized to form by the Immigration Act of 1924 (a.k.a.
                        the National Origins Act) which set strict quotas on the number of immigrants allowed to enter
                        the United States from the Eastern hemisphere, as part of a set of immigration laws made to
                        intentionally exclude and limit the numbers of Asian immigrants from the United States.
                        In other words, U.S. immigration policy has always been backed by the threat and use of
                        exclusionary, racist violence.

                    <p>
                        In recent years, border militia groups like the Three Percenters and United Constitutional
                        Patriots, have organized trips to patrol the southern border. At the border, their operations
                        are openly welcomed and sometimes even coordinated with Border Patrol agents. The far-right
                        militia groups use intimidation as they patrol their border, openly carrying AR-15s and other
                        tactical weaponry, and destroy life-saving food, water, and medicine that activists place for
                        immigrants crossing. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, these far-right militia
                        groups operate like paramilitaries and often overlap with antigovernment groups, peddling
                        conspiracy theories like QAnon. While these groups peaked during the Obama years, spurred on by
                        the presence of a black president in office and the idea that Obama was welcoming undocumented
                        immigrants, their presence has remained powerful on the border during the Trump-era.

                    <p>The connections between federal immigration policy, white supremacy, and border violence are
                        widespread and historically situated. Importantly, anti-immigrant violence tends to reinforce
                        commonly held understandings of social ordering of U.S. society based on race and immigration.
                        In other words, anti-immigrant violence is a necessary logic to the political and social making
                        U.S. society—it determines identities of who is included and who is excluded. In recent years,
                        the uptick in state-sanctioned and welcomed violence at the U.S.-Mexico border has been brought
                        on by the Obama-era expansion of militarization of the Border Patrol and border, the Trump-era
                        increase in institutional and discursive power of white supremacist movements, and overall
                        popular antipathy by the public to deteriorating conditions of human rights at the U.S.-Mexico
                        border and across the immigrant deportation and detention system in the United States.

                        This map charts Border Patrol apprehensions from 2014 to 2020, showing the massive upticks in
                        apprehension rates at the southwestern border in 2014 and 2019 during the “crises” declared by
                        Obama and Trump. The drop-off in detentions in 2020, gestures to a shift in border violence and
                        policy created by President Trump’s “Stay in Mexico” Act, whereby the U.S. contracts the Mexican
                        government to detain immigrants and enforce U.S. immigration law in Mexico, before migrants
                        reach the U.S.-Mexico border. The Border Patrol defines apprehensions as “the physical control
                        or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result
                        in an arrest.” In other words, apprehensions refers to the number of people detained, deported,
                        and cased for asylum by the U.S. Border Patrol.
